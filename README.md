Supplemental Matlab code accompanying the publication "Continuous Galerkin Schemes for Semi-Explicit Differential-Algebraic Equations" https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09336.
Run `driver_Sect41`, `driver_Sect42` or `driver_Sect43` to reproduce the numerical tests in Sections 4.1 (circuit), 4.2 (quasilinear heat equation) and 4.3 (pendulum) respectively.
